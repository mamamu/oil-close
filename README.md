Nightlife Coordinator
=========================

Project #2 for free code camp full stack.
User Stories:
* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.  
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.


Using:  Express, Passport, Yelp api, React(react-dom, axios for requests)
------------

Todos,
/- pen and paper chart it
/- base app template creation (may put this off for reasons and just use structure defined in p&p above to do this one)
/- inital api stuff--get a working api search
- react components for:
  - geolocation 👍
  - search 👍 (still need to ensure location/geolocation is persistant)
  - listdisplay (api) 👍
  - headcount and toggle (db) 👍 (have base component still need to wire up to db once it's in)
- api access stuff--clean up the api data, only need id, name, maybe link out to Yelp here, or maybe nothing else

- passport/user
- create db /initial setup  
   / -design (what user info do I need, anything to keep track of other than appts.)
- user page interaction (login page , link etc.)?? or single page login component?
- best way to display results (results are the combined set of api and db info)
